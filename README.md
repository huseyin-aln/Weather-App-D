## Acknowledgements
- Made a weather app with django using an API. 
- The city name received from the user is added to the data and data is rendered on the page. 
- If the name entered by the user exists in the data, the message "City already exists" appears on the page. 
- When the city on the page is deleted, "City deleted" message appears.
